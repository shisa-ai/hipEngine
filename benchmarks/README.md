Rows use different models and tests; compare only matching protocols. The RX 7900 XTX cross-engine rows use the same Qwen3.8 file and timing boundary.
llama.cpp Vulkan MTP is speed-only because its ledger differs from Vulkan AR;
hipEngine and llama.cpp HIP match their controls. MTP-2/MTP-3 use two/three
draft tokens. The 35B-A3B MTP-2 path matches llama.cpp MTP on the validated
suite and remains opt-in because it can differ from normal AR.

## Evidence status

| Status | Meaning | Eligible for a current numeric table? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Retained** | Correctness, provenance, repetition, and protocol gates passed for the named scope. | Yes. |
| **Current snapshot** | Clean current-production measurement used to describe the shipped route, but not itself a new optimization claim. | Yes, with that label. |
| **Diagnostic** | Useful attribution or comparison with a known limitation. | No; keep it in its artifact/changelog unless it explains a current blocker. |
| **Stale / superseded** | A newer route, dependency, or evidence contract replaced it. | No. |
| **Blocked / rejected** | The protocol could not complete or the candidate failed a gate. | No numeric topline. |

A row is scoped by platform, GPU, model fingerprint, quantization, KV type,
backend, workload, concurrency, speculative policy, and timing window. A newer
diagnostic never replaces a retained row.

Current campaign diagnostic: Qwen3.5-0.8B on Radeon 8060S/`gfx1151` ran the
full Vulkan-parity campaign (D08) to a blocked closure, then the
human-approved D08-X extension retained three prefill routes - Q5T16 QKV,
cluster8 GDN (Q4 and, after a fresh gate, Q8_0), pack8-WMMA bulk, and
dense-BF16 WMMA - moving exact-core pp512 to **4345/4983 tok/s Q4/Q8
(0.73x/0.80x Vulkan)** with public decode at llama-HIP parity. Full
per-package evidence and history live in
[`benchmarks/HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md), the D08/D08-X artifacts under
[`results/`](results/), and
[`docs/QWEN35-08B-GFX1151-VULKAN-PARITY.md`](../docs/QWEN35-08B-GFX1151-VULKAN-PARITY.md).

## Current single-request scoreboards

### Radeon Pro W7900: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B

These are the current six-shape hipEngine publication sweeps. PARO and GGUF use
different weight formats and should not be treated as a same-math A/B. `Peak`
is hipEngine tracked allocator high-water.

| Workload | PARO prefill | PARO decode | PARO peak | GGUF prefill | GGUF decode | GGUF peak |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512/128 | **2917.732** | **115.599** | 18.144 GiB | **2716.648** | **92.833** | 21.228 GiB |
| 1K/128 | **2995.876** | **103.238** | 18.367 GiB | **3052.541** | **98.148** | 21.295 GiB |
| 4K/128 | **2943.038** | **105.943** | 19.161 GiB | **2953.101** | **100.522** | 21.670 GiB |

The matched llama.cpp HIP/Vulkan comparison columns and their differing memory
scopes remain in the linked artifacts and the archived rollup rather than being
repeated here.

### Radeon Pro W7900: Qwen3.6-27B Dense GGUF

| Workload | Prefill | Autoregressive decode | Tracked peak | Status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 512/128 | **865.179 tok/s** | **28.368 tok/s** | 15.605 GiB | Pair-only Q6-QKV/Q4 gate + pair-produced full Q |
| 1024/128 | **890.634 tok/s** | **28.851 tok/s** | 15.720 GiB | Pair-only Q6-QKV/Q4 gate + pair-produced full Q |
| 4096/128 | **865.653 tok/s** | **26.332 tok/s** | 16.368 GiB | Exact pair-only/full-Q fallback + packed producers |

These rows use one discarded warmup plus three measured PM4 resets, executed
strictly serially across boards. The ordered pair-only Q6-QKV/Q4-gate route
improves binding W7900 full prefill **+0.45%/+0.74%** at M512/M1024 (11/14
paired wins); M4096 is an identical-owner exact fallback. Complete quality is
330/330 top-1 at max KL 0.014671, tracked peaks are byte-identical, and
decode/MTP ownership is unchanged. The latest absolute 1K/4K rows are
0.33%/0.30% below the prior publication under monotonic run drift, while the
same-session route wins both binding rows. The exact natural-octet Q5 source-F16
producer improves binding counterbalanced W7900
full prefill **+1.49%/+0.78%/+0.61%** at 512/1K/4K (20/21 wins), with exact
trajectories and byte-identical tracked peaks. Independent 512/1K absolute rows
are 0.47%/0.15% below the prior publication under run-to-run spread, while the
binding same-session route wins every row. The selective pair-owned Q4
source-F16 producer improves binding counterbalanced
W7900 full prefill **+1.12%/+0.67%/+0.59%** at 512/1K/4K (20/21 wins), with
exact trajectories and byte-identical tracked peaks. Its independent 4K absolute
row is 0.31% below the prior publication under run-to-run spread, while the
same-session candidate wins 6/7. The exact record-owned planar-Q6 producer
improves counterbalanced W7900 full prefill
**+3.31%/+1.71%/+1.30%** at 512/1K/4K (21/21 wins) with exact trajectories and
byte-identical tracked peaks. The exact
unequal-output Q4 pair improves counterbalanced W7900 full prefill
**+1.39%/+1.53%/+1.17%** at 512/1K/4K; the isolated 4K confirmation wins 7/7,
while tracked residency and decode ownership are unchanged. The Q5
recurrent-output extension improves counterbalanced W7900 full prefill
**+4.91%/+5.07%/+4.82%** at 512/1K/4K (21/21 wins) without changing decode
ownership or tracked residency. Exact zero-workspace selected rocBLAS FP16 GEMMs
also improve the earlier counterbalanced W7900 package **+0.17%/+1.32%** at
512/4K; no selected prior-shape 1K solution exists.
Against the same-commit diagnostic dual-layout rollback, the earlier shared
package default improves
prefill **152.61-184.82%**, decode **17.58-18.74%**, and whole-device peak delta
**45.50-47.03%**, with exact outputs and clean teardown. The current exact
natural suite is true AR **20.516 tok/s** and B3 **60.875 tok/s / 2.9672x**;
its lower absolute rate than the historical **61.147** row is protocol/code
drift, not a single-layout regression. Evidence:
[`same-commit W7900 non-regression`](results/2026-08-12-qwen36-27b-w7900-single-layout-non-regression.json).
The superseded dual-layout publication remains in the
[`latest-Vulkan parity exhaustion audit`](results/2026-08-07-qwen36-27b-latest-vulkan-parity-exhaustion-audit.json).

### RX 7900 XTX: Qwen3.8-27B Dense GGUF cross-engine comparison

#### Prefill

| Workload | hipEngine | llama.cpp HIP | HE vs HIP | llama.cpp Vulkan | HE vs Vulkan |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512 | **959.4** | 965.0 | -0.6% | 865.7 | +10.8% |
| 1K | **999.7** | 979.5 | +2.1% | 832.6 | +20.1% |
| 4K | **981.8** | 945.7 | +3.8% | 836.5 | +17.4% |

#### Decode / MTP

| Metric | hipEngine | llama.cpp HIP | HE vs HIP | llama.cpp Vulkan | HE vs Vulkan |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| AR decode 512 | **34.06** | 32.86 | +3.6% | 13.39 | 2.54x |
| AR decode 1K | **34.91** | 32.75 | +6.6% | 13.38 | 2.61x |
| AR decode 4K | **31.79** | 32.41 | -1.9% | 13.31 | 2.39x |
| MTP natural | **62.44 B3** | 44.33 B2 | +40.9% | 73.33 B2 | -14.8% |

Fixed-shape rows use token 9707 and 128 timed transitions. Prefill is a
three-run hipEngine median versus llama-bench's five-sample mean. MTP uses all
ten category prompts plus the heldout split; B1-B5 were swept independently
for each llama.cpp backend. hipEngine B3 is exact, and llama.cpp HIP B2 matches
its AR output ledger. llama.cpp Vulkan B2 is a labeled speed-only comparator
because its output ledger differs from Vulkan AR. Evidence:
[`Qwen3.8 cross-engine comparison`](results/2026-08-15-qwen38-27b-xtx-hip-vulkan-comparison.json) and
[`clean-idle hipEngine correction`](results/2026-08-15-qwen38-27b-xtx-clean-idle-performance-correction.json).

The real single-request BF16 server roof is now bracketed separately. The
operational **32K** row peaks at **21.869 GiB** with **2.115 GiB** free. A
pre-sized contiguous KV pool reaches an observed **52K** ceiling
(53,248 total tokens) at **23.959 GiB**, leaving only **0.025 GiB**; **53K**
(54,272 tokens) and all larger controls through 64K abort out of resources.
The 52K row is a physical-roof diagnostic, not a reliable serving setting, so
32K remains recommended. Evidence: [`Qwen3.8 BF16 context roof`](results/2026-08-15-qwen38-27b-xtx-bf16-context-roof.json).

The pure FP32-scale INT8 route now has a bounded exact-prefill owner. Reusing
one BF16 K/V oracle pair instead of 16 lowers 32K-capacity tracked peak
**18.943 -> 17.330 GiB**, which is also **0.590 GiB below BF16**. On matched
4K/128 runs, prefill is within **-0.050%** of BF16 graph with overlapping
sample ranges, while eager INT8 decode is **6.50% faster**. Complete 512/8 and
4K/16 quality pass, and the bounded W7900 `mixed_v1` gate now reaches
**129,024 prompt tokens / 16 teacher-forced steps** with mean/max KL
**0.0000104/0.0001354**, **100% top-1**, finite logits, all 16 full-attention
layers INT8, and zero BF16 mirror bytes. This is a bounded one-prompt long row,
not a complete 129K category suite.

Guard-free page-aligned XTX probes close the actual c1 boundary. **129,024 total
tokens (126K, 504 pages)** completes one exact natural request at
**23.962624 GiB** peak with **0.021751 GiB** sampled headroom and clean
ownership. The next page, **129,280 tokens**, stalls raw warmup beyond 600
seconds; **130,048 tokens (127K)** returns startup HIP OOM. Separately, four
different natural **112K** requests pass at **23.322876/0.661499 GiB**
peak/headroom, so 112K remains the strongest repeated server evidence while
126K is the measured one-request physical ceiling. No arbitrary reserve
reclassifies a completed row. Long pure INT8 still uses the unverified gate,
graph capture rejects it, exact natural B3 is only **0.6423x** true AR, and BF16
remains supported/default.

Do not transfer the c1 ceiling to concurrent serving. Current packed
short-context INT8 retains a BF16 mirror and is not a compact memory route. The
XTX table reports only observed execution and actual failures:

| Offered HTTP clients | Physical residency | Highest observed working row | Strongest repetition at/near frontier | First actual failure observed | Peak / headroom at highest pass |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | ---: |
| 1 | 1 | **126K/request** | 112K: 4/4 different natural requests | **126.25K:** startup stall; **127K:** startup HIP OOM | 23.963 / 0.022 GiB |
| 2 | 2 | **6K/request** | 5.5K: 8/8 multi-turn; 4.5K: 16/16 | **8K:** 0/2, HTTP 500 HIP OOM; 8.25K also has an unsupported-route startup failure | 23.972 / 0.012 GiB |
| 4 | 4 | **1.5K/request** | 16/16 multi-turn | **None tested** | 23.821 / 0.163 GiB |
| 8 | queue groups capped at physical c4 | **2K/request** | 1.5K: 8/8 shape-aware; 1.25K: 32/32 multi-turn | **None tested** | 23.974 / 0.011 GiB |

The c2 interval between the 6K pass and 8K OOM is untested. The offered-c8 2K
pass covers one burst and predates authoritative response-shape capture; it is
still an execution pass, not a failure. No exact XTX c4 or c8 failure ceiling
was measured.

The same route on W7900 reaches the model-native **256K c1** limit with one
exact request at **29.441/15.543 GiB** peak/headroom. More VRAM removes the
short mirrored-route OOM but not its software boundary or scheduler limitation:

| Offered HTTP clients | Highest pass | Observed physical groups | Requests | First failure | Peak / headroom |
| ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| 1 | **256K/request** | c1 | 1/1 | None; model context limit reached | 29.441 / 15.543 GiB |
| 2 | **8K/request** | c2 | 2/2 | 8.25K resident-prepare `NotImplementedError` | 25.658 / 19.326 GiB |
| 4 | **8K/request** | c2 + c2 | 4/4 | 8.25K resident-prepare `NotImplementedError` | 30.684 / 14.301 GiB |
| 8 | **8K/request** | c1 + c3 + c4 | 8/8 | 8.25K resident-prepare `NotImplementedError` | 30.707 / 14.277 GiB |

This capacity soak used non-streaming blocking requests. Its c2/c4/c8 shapes
therefore describe the compatible-sampling HTTP coalescer, not live resident
membership; offered width does not equal one submitted physical width. The raw
`/ready` field also reported `continuous_decode=false` because that endpoint
used a hardcoded default rather than the loaded engine capability.

A separate W7900 controlled-SSE gate at 512 prompt + 24 decode tokens qualifies
the short mirrored route's resident lifecycle. With c1 already observed in
decode, three more requests joined; sampled occupancy moved
`0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0`, all four rows exactly matched independent c1
token oracles, admitted/reclaimed deltas were `4/4`, and final
active/occupied/refcounted ownership was zero. Cancellation, elastic-pool and
overload gates remain open, and this does **not** turn the mirrored <=8K route
into compact INT8 KV.

### Radeon 8060S: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B GGUF

This is the latest clean, exact one-queue production snapshot. The artifact is a
campaign completion gate, not a claim that its final step improved every row.

| Workload | Prefill | Decode | Tracked peak | Whole-device GTT peak |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

Repeated 128K remains blocked by the documented later-pass lifecycle stall; no
numeric 128K row is carried forward. Evidence:

The W7900 Laguna decode campaign and rejected H7/H8 ladders are implementation
history, not scoreboard content; follow the production artifact, changelog, and
[`docs/LAGUNA-PARITY-STATUS.md`](../docs/LAGUNA-PARITY-STATUS.md).

## Current concurrency scoreboards

All values are aggregate generated tokens per second. Direct rows time the
resident model path; server rows include the named OpenAI serving protocol and
must not be compared as the same timing scope.

### W7900 Qwen3.6-35B-A3B GGUF `UD-Q4_K_M`

| Interface | c1 | c2 | c4 | c8 | c9 | c13 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Direct engine | **98.263** | **148.944** | **209.304** | **266.479** | — | — |
| OpenAI SSE | **72.169** | — | — | **158.542** | **137.001** | **129.507** |

Direct c1 uses HIP graph; the admitted c2/c4/c8 rows use the exact scoped PM4
transport. Server c9/c13 are declared grouped execution, not native widths.
All 189 server request rows and 24,192 generated IDs pass the exact gate.

MTP ratios always use a true no-MTP AR path from the same protocol. Verifier
`off`/`B0` diagnostics are not speedup denominators. The full category suite,
heldouts, and anti-gaming rules are mandatory; see
[`docs/BENCHMARK.md`](../docs/BENCHMARK.md#anti-gaming).

## Maple-Preview retained backend comparison

These are same-model retained rows, but CUDA and HIP run on different hardware.

CUDA resident batching and serving are not claimed by these c1 rows.

## Current PM4 transport diagnostic

This is a transport diagnostic for the W7900 Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M one-step
replay path, not a separate model-throughput topline.

| Transport | Replay | Capture | Status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| HIP graph | **10.726350 ms/token / 93.228 tok/s** | 34.993 ms | Portable oracle and fallback |
| Stateful PM4, global acquire | **10.052766 / 99.475** | 79.296 ms warm-metadata | Exact comparison path |
| Stateful PM4, local-cache acquire | **9.964358 / 100.358** | 132.858 ms cold | Scoped default when the measured replay window amortizes capture |

Evidence: [`local-cache capture/replay`](results/2026-08-08-gfx1100-pm4-setup-local-cache-clean.json)
and [`scoped default`](results/2026-08-08-gfx1100-pm4-scoped-default.json).

## Reading the tables

- Workload format is `prompt_tokens/decode_tokens`.
- Prefill, backend decode, full request wall, server wall, and component timing
  are different scopes. Compare only like with like.
- Aggregate concurrency throughput is total generated tokens divided by group
  wall. Per-request throughput is lower when multiple requests share the GPU.
- PARO, GGUF, and llama.cpp rows may use different quantization or KV formats;
  raw leaders are descriptive unless the artifact establishes a matched A/B.
- hipEngine tracked memory and whole-device VRAM/GTT are different scopes.
- A bold value identifies the reported row, not a universal claim across
  mismatched hardware, models, or protocols.

## Maintenance contract

Keep this file compact:

1. Replace the current row for a protocol tuple; do not append an optimization
   diary beneath it.
2. Put exact commands, samples, deltas, profiler data, correctness details, and
   candidate decisions in the compact JSON artifact.
3. Put the one-line old-to-new transition in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and
   substantial implementation decisions in a new immutable worklog entry.
4. Mention a blocked/rejected run here only when it removes a current numeric
   row or defines a user-visible limitation. Link one artifact and one rerun
   condition; keep candidate ladders out of the scoreboard.
5. Keep superseded tables in [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md), artifacts, or Git
   history rather than copying them forward.
6. Update `Last updated`, then synchronize the public block:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_benchmark_readme.py --write
python3 scripts/sync_benchmark_readme.py --check
git diff --check
```

The full evidence and artifact requirements remain authoritative in
[`docs/BENCHMARK.md`](../docs/BENCHMARK.md).
