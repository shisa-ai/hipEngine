# hipEngine Topline Benchmarks

Last updated: **2026-08-25**

This file is the current benchmark scoreboard. It intentionally contains only
current user-facing results, compact protocol/status notes, and links to the
authoritative evidence. It is not an optimization journal.

Rows use different models and tests; compare only matching protocols. The RX 7900 XTX cross-engine rows use the same Qwen3.8 file and timing boundary.
llama.cpp Vulkan MTP is speed-only because its ledger differs from Vulkan AR; hipEngine and llama.cpp HIP match their controls. MTP-2/MTP-3 use two/three draft tokens. The 35B-A3B MTP-2 path matches llama.cpp MTP on the validated suite and remains opt-in because it can differ from normal AR.

## Current default notes

Strix Halo Qwen3.8 `Q4_K_S` defaults to FP16 recurrent state with FP32 rollback
([`evidence`](results/2026-08-20-gfx1151-qwen38-27b-r2-fp16-state-repaired-production.json)).
The exact `Q4_K_M` W8192 DMS sidecar passes 32K/128K at 100% top-1, saves
3.750 GiB live K/V at 128K, and matches dense c1 decode. It stays default-off
pending serving gates. [`DMS status`](../docs/DMS.md).

SPECDEC2-PERF P2 retains exact streaming prompt activation for strict C1/K2:
full-suite throughput improves **14.294→16.237 tok/s (+13.59%)**, every category
is positive, and staged reaches **1.486x true AR** with one 10 KiB carried row.
Physical C2/C4 streaming is rejected because `general_en` regresses despite
aggregate gains; exact replay remains. p4K/p16K eager streaming is also rejected
and those contexts select K0 before provider mutation. P3 additionally removes
the two steady proposal/repair allocation pairs: every physical full-suite cycle
and warmed profiler window is allocation-free, with complete wall neutral within
noise. Automatic/product policy remains K0; no public scope promotes.
[`P3 evidence`](results/2026-08-25-gfx1151-specdec2-perf-p3-stable-slabs.json).

gfx1100 SPECDEC2-PERF now retains a clean C1 streaming checkpoint. Dense
Qwen3.6-27B GGUF K1/K2/K3 is exact at **1.259x/1.365x/1.419x true AR**, but
remains **3.6%/6.2%/5.3%** behind direct MTP. Exact p128/p512 streaming loses
AR, while p4K/p16K stays pre-mutation K0. Dense P3 stable slabs are exact with
K1/K2/K3 wall neutral at **+0.75%/+0.21%/+0.03%**; only persistent graph-bucket
first use remains. Packed PARO production is exact and zero-allocation across
**372/372** cycles; P4 device candidate handoff improves staged wall **4.33%**
to **0.979x AR** with 372 device handoffs and bounded post-target rows. Strict
D8 allocation falls **1,110 malloc/free pairs → 0** and P4 cycle marker wall is
**83.469 ms**. Both automatic policies remain K0; physical C2/C4 is not exposed.

## Benchmark harness catalog

There is no single "run everything" benchmark. Different questions are answered
by different harnesses, each with a specific timing scope, numerical contract,
and shape. The table below is the map: it says what each harness measures so a
result is only compared against like-for-like rows. A ✓ marks what a harness
owns and reports; a column left blank means that axis is not measured by that
harness (not that it is zero). Always run hipEngine rows through the hermetic
thecrock wrapper for the target architecture (see `docs/BENCHMARK.md`).

Legend: **AR** = true no-MTP autoregressive decode · **MTP** = speculative
multi-token-prediction decode (with a true-AR denominator where a ratio is
reported) · **Prefill** = prompt-processing tok/s · **Decode** = generation
tok/s · **Mem** = tracked/HIP/GTT memory usage · **Conc** = per-concurrency
(c=1..8) sweep.

| `benchmark_matrix.py` | Join exact-token direct/server rows into a validated matrix report | ✓ | ✓ | | | | | `build --manifest ...` |

The two rows that most closely produce the README **concurrency scoreboards**
are `qwen35_batch_retained_bench.py` (direct engine) and `server_f1_concurrency_bench.py`
(OpenAI server). The **single-request** tables come from `qwen35_readme_sweep.py`
(GGUF/PARO) and `qwen35_gguf_bench.py`. The **speculative-decode** tables come
from `gguf_ar_mtp_suite.py` / `gguf_mtp_category_bench.py` with a
`gguf_true_ar_category_bench.py` true-AR denominator.

This catalog is maintained alongside the harnesses themselves: when a harness
learns a new axis (for example MTP added to a previously AR-only bench), update
this table in the same unit.

## Evidence status

| Status | Meaning | Eligible for a current numeric table? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Retained** | Correctness, provenance, repetition, and protocol gates passed for the named scope. | Yes. |
| **Current snapshot** | Clean current-production measurement used to describe the shipped route, but not itself a new optimization claim. | Yes, with that label. |
| **Diagnostic** | Useful attribution or comparison with a known limitation. | No; keep it in its artifact/changelog unless it explains a current blocker. |
| **Stale / superseded** | A newer route, dependency, or evidence contract replaced it. | No. |
| **Blocked / rejected** | The protocol could not complete or the candidate failed a gate. | No numeric topline. |

A row is scoped by platform, model/quant/KV, workload, concurrency, policy, and
timing window. A newer diagnostic never replaces a retained row.

## Current Generation-2 qualification

W7900 Qwen3.6-35B-A3B `UD-Q4_K_M`, BF16 KV, p128/d8, token-budget
scheduling, and same-loaded-server c1 oracles:

| Logical concurrency | 1 | 4 | 8 | 17 | 32 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Aggregate HTTP tok/s | **27.443** | **43.337** | **46.158** | **45.797** | **44.320** |
| Exact rows | 1/1 | 4/4 | 8/8 | 17/17 | 32/32 |

The canonical W7900 packet retains physical c1/c2/c4/c8 and logical c1-c32:
all nine fixed/ragged/load/cancel/overload/recovery/soak workloads pass 210/210
correctness-accounted rows, bounded overload, complete admission/reclaim, and
zero final ownership or tracked-memory delta. Exact Qwen3.8 physical c1-c8 and
its planar-Q6 row8 kernel are also retained; detailed rows remain in the
benchmark changelog and result artifacts.

On Radeon 8060S/gfx1151, the final Qwen3.8 `Q4_K_S` package retains queue2,
exact physical c1-c8/logical c1-c32 mechanics, packed prefill, direct resident
state, Q4 row8 two-wave, and scoped Q5 col8. The 130-row width, 2,100-request
load, context/graph/prefix/pressure, and lifecycle packets pass. Product closure
remains blocked at c32: **10.590 tok/s**, **18.617 s TTFT p95**, **2.125 s ITL
p99**, **24.171 s E2E p95**, and **0/3 SLO runs**; C2 64K and heavy-load SLOs
also remain blocked. [`gfx1151 campaign final`](results/2026-08-24-gfx1151-qwen38-concurrency2-campaign-final.json).

## Current Qwen3.6-35B quantization quality

The current gate scores 90 full-vocabulary BF16-teacher positions across all ten
code/English/Japanese/mixed prompts. Every row uses the exact local artifacts
and identical teacher contexts; no historical or unmatched-artifact rows are
mixed into this table. This is a cross-runtime distribution gate, not
held-out-corpus PPL.

| Exact local artifact | Size / BPW | Evidence scope | Mean KL vs BF16 ↓ | Top-1 agreement ↑ | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| GGUF `UD-Q4_K_M` | 21.107 GiB / 5.180 | exact-artifact, ROCmFPX HIP | **0.013713** | 92.222% | Matched-runtime quality baseline |
| ROCmFP4 STRIX_LEAN | **17.739 GiB / 4.354** | exact-artifact, ROCmFPX HIP | 0.045984 | **97.778%** | Quality-traded: KL/category margin fails |
| PARO full8192 packed | 19.068 GiB / 4.680 | exact-artifact, hipEngine HIP | 0.027038 | 92.222% | Quality-traded; runtime-correct and deterministic |

ROCmFP4 is 15.96% smaller than local Q4_K_M and retains more BF16 greedy
argmaxes, but fails the paired KL/category margin. PARO is runtime-correct and
deterministic after the packed-layout repair, yet remains quality-traded versus
hipEngine Q4_K_M. See the [`quality artifact`](results/2026-08-16-zbook-qwen36-quant-quality.json)
and [`protocol`](quant/README.md).

Current package decisions are compactly separated by execution profile:

- Packed PARO retains exact SiLU+down-rotation (**1.371x leaf, 69 fewer c8/L4
  launches**) with neutral aggregate wall; unsafe math is rejected.
- ZBook strict c1 retains the exact cooperative router (**30.438 -> 33.219
  tok/s, 18/18 wins**). Physical c4/c8 retain exact Q8T16 rowtiling while c2
  remains direct.
- The combined c1/cN package is exact over **1,050/1,050 rows** and remains the
  implementation default, but is not a public `production` profile: the
  60-second server soak completed 87/120 requests and rejected 33 as overloaded.

Evidence: [`PARO boundary`](results/2026-08-16-qwen36-35b-gfx1151-rocmfpx-opp3-silu-rotate-retained.json),
[`c1 router`](results/2026-08-16-zbook-qwen36-c1-router-retained.json),

[`package decision`](results/2026-08-16-zbook-qwen36-production-profile-cn-blocked.json), and the
[`ROCmFPX transfer report`](quant/ROCMFPX-TRANSFER.md).

Current Qwen3.5-0.8B gfx1151 status remains **Vulkan parity blocked**, while
the exact D08-X package is retained. Its clean three-way exact-core pp512 is
hipEngine / llama HIP / Vulkan **4896/4848/5510 Q4** and **4997/4640/5704 Q8
tok/s**. Retained operation-complete units include Q4 pack8 gate+up+SiLU,
dense-BF16 down+residual, and Q8T16 alpha/beta dual WMMA; the final natural and
category gate is **1794/1800 top-1, max KL 0.005930**, with all **72/72** graph
trajectories exact. Rejected projection, GDN-broadcast, and pack8-residual
candidates remain in artifacts and the changelog. Evidence:

## Current single-request scoreboards

### Radeon Pro W7900: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B

The repaired-runtime publication uses two warmups and five measured resets per
right-sized session. `Peak` is hipEngine tracked allocator high-water.

| Workload | PARO prefill | PARO decode | PARO peak | GGUF prefill | GGUF decode | GGUF peak |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512/128 | **2852.100** | **115.804** | **18.144 GiB** | 2763.590 | 94.603 | 21.073 GiB |
| 1K/128 | 2965.063 | **103.113** | **18.367 GiB** | **3198.957** | 99.728 | 21.133 GiB |
| 4K/128 | 2927.519 | **106.020** | **19.161 GiB** | **3177.565** | 101.917 | 21.468 GiB |
| 32K/128 | 2085.511 | **92.422** | **19.851 GiB** | **2154.871** | 89.432 | 22.060 GiB |
| 64K/128 | 1559.680 | **79.098** | **20.344 GiB** | **1600.734** | 78.021 | 22.736 GiB |
| 128K/128 | 1049.467 | 61.804 | **21.881 GiB** | **1058.075** | **63.177** | 24.088 GiB |

PARO leads short-context generation and memory; GGUF leads prefill from 1K and
128K generation. IDs, variance gates, and clean provenance pass. Evidence:
[`PARO sweep`](results/2026-08-23-w7900-current-default-hipengine-paro-packed-5run.json), [`GGUF sweep`](results/2026-08-23-w7900-current-default-hipengine-gguf-q4km-5run.json).

### Radeon Pro W7900: Qwen3.6-27B Dense GGUF

This `Q4_K_M`/BF16-KV snapshot uses one warmup and three measured resident
resets per shape with state-bound PM4 graph decode.

| Workload | Prefill | Decode | Tracked peak |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512/128 | **875.364 tok/s** | **28.681 tok/s** | 15.587 GiB |
| 1K/128 | **911.658 tok/s** | **29.383 tok/s** | 15.681 GiB |
| 4K/128 | **878.721 tok/s** | **26.747 tok/s** | 16.204 GiB |

All nine IDs are stable/finite; prefill/decode CV is at most 0.733%/0.475%, and
the ten-prompt gate is exact. [`Current-default evidence`](results/2026-08-23-w7900-qwen36-27b-current-default-publication.json). Qwen3.8 details remain in the XTX tables above.

### Radeon 8060S: Qwen3.8-27B Dense GGUF retained campaign state

Qwen3.8 uses `Q4_K_S` with BF16 K/V. The campaign is closed at merged commit
`20e5106da`; the Q5 source-F16 prefill retention (2026-08-17) raises 512/1K/4K
prefill on gfx1151 via the byte-identical K_M-derived Q5T16 recurrent-output
route (counterbalanced +4.51%/+3.02% at 512/1K, +2.95% at 4K with a
capacity-conditional scratch cap that keeps 8K+ memory flat). Prefill and true
AR beat both clean llama backends at every working shape, exact native B3 beats
the correctness-valid llama HIP row, and process GTT stays below the lower
valid llama row at 512/1K/8K+ (4K peak grows a fixed +2.30 GiB to enable the
4K source-F16 win).

| Shape | Clean prefill | Clean AR | Retained process GTT | Lower valid llama GTT |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512/128 | **396.091** | **13.069** | **15.275 GiB** | 15.785 GiB |
| 1K/128 | **387.648** | **12.894** | **15.710 GiB** | 15.816 GiB |
| 4K/128 | **380.305** | **13.038** | **17.863 GiB** | 16.004 GiB |

Exact native B3 is **23.85263 tok/s / 1.7845x AR** with all ten prompt
trajectories and GPU/CPU acceptance decisions exact; retained process GTT is
**15.899 GiB** versus valid llama HIP's **16.358 GiB**. Natural true AR is
**13.36641 tok/s** versus same-file llama Q4_K_S HIP/Vulkan at
**5.53853/7.51888 tok/s**. Rejected aliases and direct file mapping remain
recorded—not discarded—in the linked evidence.

### Radeon 8060S: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B GGUF

This is the latest clean, exact one-queue production snapshot. The artifact is a
campaign completion gate, not a claim that its final step improved every row.

| Workload | Prefill | Decode | Tracked peak | Whole-device GTT peak |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512/128 | **1369.489 tok/s** | **54.330 tok/s** | 20.566 GiB | 21.000 GiB |

Repeated 128K remains blocked by the documented later-pass lifecycle stall; no
numeric 128K row is carried forward. Evidence:

### Laguna S 2.1

| Platform / format | Workload | Prefill | Decode | Evidence |

The W7900 Laguna decode campaign and rejected H7/H8 ladders are implementation
history, not scoreboard content; follow the production artifact, changelog, and
[`docs/LAGUNA-PARITY-STATUS.md`](../docs/LAGUNA-PARITY-STATUS.md).

Explicit gfx1151 Laguna DFlash remains non-default and uses the tile1 target
verifier. The attempted tile4 transfer was trajectory-identical to tile1 but
failed the shared full-suite true-AR gate and did not improve complete E2E wall;
see the [`tile4 rejection`](results/2026-08-20-gfx1151-laguna-dflash-iq3-tile4-rejected.json).

## Current concurrency scoreboards

All values are aggregate generated tokens per second. Direct rows time the
resident model path; server rows include the named OpenAI serving protocol and
must not be compared as the same timing scope.

### W7900 Qwen3.6-35B-A3B GGUF `UD-Q4_K_M`

| Interface | c1 | c2 | c4 | c8 | c9 | c13 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| OpenAI SSE | **72.169** | — | — | **158.542** | **137.001** | **129.507** |

Direct c1 uses HIP graph; the admitted c2/c4/c8 rows use the exact scoped PM4
transport. Server c9/c13 are declared grouped execution, not native widths.
All 189 server request rows and 24,192 generated IDs pass the exact gate.

MTP ratios always use a true no-MTP AR path from the same protocol. Verifier
`off`/`B0` diagnostics are not speedup denominators. The full category suite,
heldouts, and anti-gaming rules are mandatory; see
[`docs/BENCHMARK.md`](../docs/BENCHMARK.md#anti-gaming).

## Maple-Preview retained backend comparison

These are same-model retained rows, but CUDA and HIP run on different hardware.

| Platform | Workload | Current throughput | Exactness / scope | Artifact |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Radeon 8060S | Native prefill 128/320/512 | **750.854 / 741.890 / 754.458 tok/s** | 18/18 states, 90/90 positions, KL 0 | [`P4`](results/2026-08-08-gfx1151-maple-p4-long-prefill-public-batch-retained.json) |

CUDA resident batching and serving are not claimed by these c1 rows.

## Current PM4 transport diagnostic

This is a transport diagnostic for the W7900 Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M one-step
replay path, not a separate model-throughput topline.

| Transport | Replay | Capture | Status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| HIP graph | **10.726350 ms/token / 93.228 tok/s** | 34.993 ms | Portable oracle and fallback |
| Stateful PM4, global acquire | **10.052766 / 99.475** | 79.296 ms warm-metadata | Exact comparison path |
| Stateful PM4, local-cache acquire | **9.964358 / 100.358** | 132.858 ms cold | Scoped default when the measured replay window amortizes capture |

Evidence: [`local-cache capture/replay`](results/2026-08-08-gfx1100-pm4-setup-local-cache-clean.json)
and [`scoped default`](results/2026-08-08-gfx1100-pm4-scoped-default.json).

## Reading the tables

- Workload format is `prompt_tokens/decode_tokens`.
- Prefill, backend decode, full request wall, server wall, and component timing
  are different scopes. Compare only like with like.
- Aggregate concurrency throughput is total generated tokens divided by group
  wall. Per-request throughput is lower when multiple requests share the GPU.
- PARO, GGUF, and llama.cpp rows may use different quantization or KV formats;
  raw leaders are descriptive unless the artifact establishes a matched A/B.
- hipEngine tracked memory and whole-device VRAM/GTT are different scopes.
- A bold value identifies the reported row, not a universal claim across
  mismatched hardware, models, or protocols.

## Maintenance contract

1. Replace the current row for a protocol tuple; do not append an optimization
   diary beneath it.
2. Put exact commands, samples, deltas, profiler data, correctness details, and
   candidate decisions in the compact JSON artifact.
3. Put the one-line old-to-new transition in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and
   substantial implementation decisions in a new immutable worklog entry.
4. Mention a blocked/rejected run here only when it removes a current numeric
   row or defines a user-visible limitation. Link one artifact and one rerun
   condition; keep candidate ladders out of the scoreboard.
5. Keep superseded tables in [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md), artifacts, or Git
   history rather than copying them forward (`git show 6a8d38ae70b9e2c4244df10d8621db83da6c8112:benchmarks/README.md`).
6. Update `Last updated`, then synchronize the public block:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_benchmark_readme.py --write
python3 scripts/sync_benchmark_readme.py --check
git diff --check
```

The full evidence and artifact requirements remain authoritative in
[`docs/BENCHMARK.md`](../docs/BENCHMARK.md).
