# Laguna S 2.1 Prefill Attack Plan

Last updated: 2026-07-25

Status: active successor to the completed LPF/AR-O campaign in
[`LAGUNA.md`](LAGUNA.md). The prior bounded tasks are closed; this plan starts a
new arithmetic and data-layout campaign. It does not reactivate the rejected
expert-major F16 runtime routes. LAP-1 is complete with a direct resident-T16
MMQ32 consumer; LAP-2 residual calibration and exact repair are active.

## Outcome

Close the resident c=1 Laguna S 2.1 Q4_K_M prefill gap on Radeon 8060S/gfx1151
without weakening hipEngine's quality, fallback, memory, or plugin contracts.
The primary external control is the current local llama.cpp Vulkan build at
`c0bc8591e8815c63cb01dd3f051a8b0df02501c9`, which measures
**344.56 +/- 3.16 tok/s** at pp512. hipEngine's retained matrix512/attention128
default measures **76.226 tok/s** at 512 rows, a **4.520x** gap.

The first design is:

1. source-faithful Q4_K/Q6_K packed integer-dot MMQ over natural expert-major
   rows;
2. one activation quantization per producer row, before top-10 expansion where
   possible;
3. residual Q8_1 planes plus conservative BF16-boundary detection;
4. sparse exact recomputation with a bounded, fail-closed queue;
5. the existing exact `gguf_q4_k_t16_v1` expert layout as the sole resident
   set, with a direct T16 packed-dot consumer rather than a per-dispatch
   transpose;
6. exact fallbacks selected by quant, projection role, and measured shape—not
   prompt, token, or hand-picked layer ID.

Selected Q4 gate/up is first, then Q4/Q6 down, dense/shared Q4/Q6, source-F16
projection, and finally cooperative tiled attention. Submission and graph work
remain deferred.

The first 2026-07-25 layout checkpoint changed item 5. X8 remains the fastest
proven MMQ32 input and an important arithmetic control, but its optimized
exact fallback is **1.11093x** retained T16 at c=1 and **1.02987x** at c=2 on
the actual layer-1 gate/up pair. It catches T16 at c=4/c=8 and is BF16-bit
exact, but the campaign target is c=1 and the <=2% decode gate is mandatory.
The prior “X8 wins” resident decision is therefore reversed: do not add a
complete T16 sidecar to X8, and do not integrate X8 into the runtime. The
direct T16 consumer now passes the frozen leaf gate at
**2.502x/3.959x/5.502x** retained on M128/M256/M512 and within
**4.66%/4.05%/3.02%** of X8, so the immediate attack moves to repaired
arithmetic on that sole-resident layout.

This document uses stable `LAP-*` labels (“Laguna arithmetic prefill”). Numeric
task-tracker IDs may be assigned separately; the labels deliberately do not
reuse historical task numbers.

## Scope

The campaign target is frozen to:

| Item | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Model | `/models/gguf/laguna-s-2.1-Q4_K_M.gguf`, SHA-256 `7da520c5f44bc3c79d4eeebfd1151ba7114c5d7568e72a995638417093c5753f` |
| Backend | `hip_gfx1151`, Radeon 8060S / Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 |
| Runtime | torch-free, one resident weight set, c=1 model math |
| Storage | existing Q4_K/Q6_K/F16/F32 model tensors and BF16 KV |
| Headline | 512-row resident prefill with matrix chunk 512 and the retained attention policy |
| Shape coverage | canonical prompt rows plus 128/256/511/512/513/1K/4K milestone screens |
| Quality | repository primitive gate plus the complete ten-prompt, four-category train/heldout lane |
| Non-regression | h16/h32 decode within 2%, category E2E gates, lifecycle, and bounded memory |

Model load remains outside prefill timing. DFlash, c>1 throughput, loader speed,
sampling, and decode optimization are not campaign credits. They are rerun only
when shared runtime behavior changes.

## Baseline and the bridge to Vulkan

### Retained hipEngine state

The completed campaign moved repeated 512-row prefill from the pre-matrix
**47.395 tok/s** row to **76.226 tok/s**. The retained 512/1K/4K screen is
**76.226/74.538/70.885 tok/s**; the canonical category-weighted short-prompt
result is **69.761 tok/s**. The main retained changes were:

- 512-row matrix scratch and independent 128-row attention chunks;
- exact device-resident expert grouping and adaptive grouped-small-M down;
- compensated F16 WMMA on the 36 SWA layers;
- online global and SWA attention with exact fallbacks;
- exact chunk, cursor, KV, lifecycle, and complete-category gates.

The latest cleanup commit `e4ab85d59` removed only rejected expert-major runtime
experiments. It did not change the shipping path.

At 76.226 tok/s, pp512 is **6.7169 seconds**. The Vulkan control is
**1.4860 seconds**, so parity requires removing about **5.2309 seconds**, or
77.9% of current wall.

### Family bridge budget

LAP-0 replaced the pre-campaign inference with a clean cached trace at unchanged
shipping defaults. The single profiled 512-row pass measures **76.381 tok/s**,
**6.703260 seconds** synchronized wall, **6.689356 seconds** kernel sum, and
**6.699478 seconds** kernel span. This does not replace the repeated retained
**76.226 tok/s** headline; it is the internally consistent attribution row used
for the bridge.

| Cumulative modeled step | Modeled pp512 wall | Modeled tok/s | Evidence used |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Current shipping trace | 6.7033 s | 76.381 | fresh matrix512/attention128 pass |
| Apply measured LAP-1 direct-T16 leaf ratio | 3.6933 s | 138.6 | scale gate/up by 9.5966 / 52.7988 ms; not integrated |
| Match Vulkan selected Q4 gate/up | 3.6707 s | 139.5 | save 3.6786 - 0.6461 s |
| Then match Vulkan selected Q4/Q6 down | 2.9372 s | 174.3 | save 1.1001 - 0.3665 s |
| Then match Vulkan dense/shared quant | 2.3586 s | 217.1 | save 0.6415 - 0.0629 s |
| Then match Vulkan source-F16 | 1.7450 s | 293.4 | save 0.8941 - 0.2805 s |
| Then match measured current attention to Vulkan | 1.5064 s | 339.9 | save 0.2779 - 0.0393 s |
| llama.cpp Vulkan control | 1.4860 s | 344.56 | user unprofiled pp512 |

This is an Amdahl model, not a performance claim. It assumes independent family
savings across different numerical/runtime contracts. The five mapped kernel
gaps explain **99.740%** of the fresh hipEngine-minus-Vulkan kernel-sum gap and
leave **20.4 ms** between the modeled hipEngine wall and the user Vulkan wall.
A new runtime, graphs, Python removal, or a different benchmark definition is
not required to explain the 4.5x gap.

The new LAP-1 row is also modeled, not a full-model claim. Applying its clean
actual-layer direct-T16 M512 ratio
(**9.5966 / 52.7988 = 0.18176**) to the measured **3.6786-second** gate/up
family gives **0.6686 seconds**, within 3.5% of Vulkan's **0.6461-second**
family. This says the sole-resident body can close the first mapped gap; repair
and runtime integration must now prove that the ratio transfers across all 47
sparse layers. X8 remains the measured body ceiling, not the selected resident
layout.

At 512 rows, selected Q4 gate/up is **3.6786 seconds / 54.99%**, selected
Q4/Q6 down **1.1001 seconds / 16.45%**, source-F16 **0.8941 seconds / 13.37%**,
dense/shared quant **0.6415 seconds / 9.59%**, and measured global+SWA
attention **0.2779 seconds / 4.16%**. The respective hipEngine/Vulkan ratios
are **5.694x/3.001x/3.188x/10.198x/7.075x**. Named non-`other` families cover
**99.653%** of kernel time, while span-minus-sum is **0.151%**. Gate/up remains
the first target; attention remains below its start threshold.

### LAP-0 cumulative quality and shape evidence

The all-exact versus shipping-control category run passes, but the remaining
approximate budget is narrow. Shipping improves weighted prefill **53.596 ->
70.546 tok/s (1.31627x)** and h16/h32 E2E **1.18198x/1.12459x**, while decode
is neutral. Across 320 teacher-forced steps it reaches maximum KL
**0.0459275**, **319/320 (99.6875%)** top-1, and at least **98.4375%** top-1
in every category. Only **0.0040725** remains below the 0.05 KL ceiling; the
`mixed_ja_en_translate` trajectory is the only non-exact free-running pair.
New approximate paths therefore compare directly with all-exact, and repaired
BF16 equality is strongly preferred.

Natural routing showed that literal 32-row padded arithmetic was not viable.
At M512, padding factors are **1.0219/1.0684/1.1650/1.3801/1.8662x** for
2/4/8/16/32-row tiles; M256 reaches **2.9295x** at tile32. LAP-1 now keeps the
32x32 shared tile but bypasses dot accumulation for padded routes. That makes
all seven natural shapes positive without a second small-row kernel; geometry
and weight loads remain padded and are revisited only if the integrated trace
shows a material ceiling.

Two repeated BF16 activation captures at depths 2/11/20/30/39/48 are
bit-identical for M32/55/64/122/128/256/512 without persisting raw activations.
Late-layer residuals contain sparse extreme outliers: at depth 48/M512,
absolute p99 is
**16.25**, p99.9 **127,488**, and maximum **950,272**, while row-RMS p95 is
only **7.67**. These are post-layer proxies rather than exact projection
inputs, but they already reject a single global or row-wide scale as the LAP-2
premise. Exact projection-input calibration remains required before selecting
residual planes.

The compact LAP-0 evidence packet is
[`2026-07-24-gfx1151-laguna-prefill-lap0-control.json`](../benchmarks/results/2026-07-24-gfx1151-laguna-prefill-lap0-control.json).

The rejected expert-major F16 diagnostic independently supports the same
conclusion. At M512 it reached **176.001 tok/s** versus **76.395 tok/s** for the
retained route. Subtracting the unchanged non-expert wall implies an expert
sub-window near the Vulkan expert budget. That inference needs a direct trace,
but it shows that expert-major reuse—not a theoretical hardware limit—is the
missing performance mechanism.

## What the latest Vulkan implementation is doing

The read-only checkout `/home/lhl/llama.cpp/llama.cpp-vulkan` is clean at
`c0bc8591e8815c63cb01dd3f051a8b0df02501c9`, build 10107. This is the same
revision as the retained pp512 profile; its current HEAD contains no newer
Laguna-specific backend change. The latest Laguna model-support commit in that
history is `1f66c3ce1`. This identity and history were rechecked on 2026-07-25;
the MMQ and attention mechanisms audited below are still the current backend
implementation. The relevant source is:

- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/ggml-vulkan.cpp`
- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders/vulkan-shaders-gen.cpp`
- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders/mul_mmq.comp`
- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders/mul_mm_id_funcs.glsl`
- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders/flash_attn_cm1.comp`
- `src/models/laguna.cpp`

The pp512 operation ledger is:

| Vulkan family | Time | Share |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Selected Q4 gate/up | 0.6461 s | 43.69% |
| Selected Q4/Q6 down | 0.3665 s | 24.78% |
| Source-F16 projection | 0.2805 s | 18.97% |
| Dense/shared quant projection | 0.0629 s | 4.25% |
| Flash attention | 0.0393 s | 2.66% |
| Router/norm/RoPE/activation/miscellaneous | 0.0836 s | 5.65% |

The mechanisms matter more than the API:

1. Contiguous F32 activation rows are converted once to Q8_1 and cached in a
   reusable preallocated buffer.
2. A device pass counts routes per expert. Subgroup ballots compact matching
   `(token, route-slot)` row IDs into natural expert-major tiles.
3. Q4_K/Q6_K `MUL_MAT_ID` uses packed integer dot, not cooperative matrix.
   The small K-quant shader owns a 32x32 output/row tile, stages weight and
   activation blocks, and reuses each decoded weight tile across up to 32 routed
   rows.
4. On AMD, large routed matmul is disabled. The Laguna top-10 routed width
   selects the small path, and its `WMITER=1` specialization limits register
   pressure.
5. Flash attention owns 16 query rows by 64 key rows in a 256-thread
   cooperative-matrix block, performs both QK and PV, and maintains online
   softmax state. The graph gives each layer all 512 query rows instead of four
   128-row launches.
6. Graph-pattern fusions remove several tails, but they are secondary for
   hipEngine: pp512 kernel span exceeds kernel sum by only **0.144%**.

The Vulkan subgroup is 64 and its attention KV is F16, while hipEngine uses
wave32 kernels, BF16 KV, `KVLiveSpans`, and stricter quality gates. The plan
therefore transfers the tiling/dataflow, not literal shader constants or
unchecked numerical policy.

## What prior hipEngine work proved

### Laguna-specific results

| Experiment | Result | Meaning for this plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct Q8_1/dp4a selected Q4 gate/up | +4.070% category prefill, but max KL 0.171561 | Quantize-before-expansion is viable; one-plane Q8_1 arithmetic is not promotable. |
| Exact scalar grouped gate/up C4/C8/C16 | Production M55 best candidate still lost to direct | Do not retry scalar row reuse under a new tile name. |
| Diagnostic raw-Q4 DS4 WMMA32 | About 1.41x faster than selected WMMA in a synthetic shape | Integer arithmetic has potential, but this was independent-wave global loading, not Vulkan's tiled MMQ. |
| Diagnostic resident-T16 DS4 WMMA32 | About 1.48x synthetic speedup | T16 can feed a fast prototype, but the body/layout and quality contract were incomplete. |
| Expanded-Q4 LDS staging | 2.22x slower than raw WMMA32 | Staging without enough tile reuse is negative. |
| Packed-Q4 LDS staging | Recovered some loss but remained 38% slower than raw WMMA32 | Do not repeat per-block pack/sync without a complete shared-tile schedule. |
| WMMA64 widening | Only about 0.63% over WMMA32 | More independent waves are not the missing architecture. |
| Pre-unpacked Q4 preview | 1.46x slower than raw DS4 WMMA32 | Metadata decode alone is not the bottleneck. |
| Expert-major compensated F16 WMMA | 176.001 tok/s at M512; full suite max KL 0.527791 | Natural-row matrix reuse is fast enough; arithmetic accumulation is the blocker. |
| Gate/up-only / down-only F16 bisection | KL 0.988050 / 1.183662 | Neither projection can be admitted alone; combined error partly cancels. |
| Global-only / SWA-only F16 bisection | KL 0.628301 / 1.205779 | No architecture-defined layer scope is safe; arbitrary layer tuning is forbidden. |
| Byte-neutral X8 MMQ32 with live-row skip | **1.197/1.567/1.704/2.526/2.587/4.092/5.614x** retained at M32/55/64/122/128/256/512 | The packed-dot body and natural-shape schedule pass. X8 remains the prefill ceiling/control, not the resident winner. |
| Exact X8 decode, direct/staged/transformed | Direct X8 is **4.693x** T16; raw LDS staging is **2.081x**; the optimized transform is exact but clean c1/c2 is **1.11093x/1.02987x** T16 | Per-dispatch layout recovery cannot meet the <=2% c=1 decode gate. Keep T16 resident and add a direct T16 MMQ address specialization. |
| Direct resident-T16 MMQ32 | **1.174/1.528/1.662/2.464/2.502/3.959/5.502x** retained at M32/55/64/122/128/256/512 | LAP-1 passes: T16 matches X8 BF16 bits, stays within 4.66%/4.05%/3.02% at primary shapes, and needs no transpose or sidecar. |

The older scalar and independent-WMMA variants in
`hipengine/kernels/hip_gfx1100/quant/gguf_q4_k_q8_1_selected_prefill.{hip,py}`
remain negative controls. The shared-tile X8 MMQ32 symbol remains the
arithmetic/performance control, while the direct T16-native sibling is the
retained LAP-1 candidate primitive. Neither has a runtime route yet.

### Transfer from the successful Qwen3.x campaign

Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q3_K_M on gfx1100 progressed through:

| Retained step | 512 / mixed-4K tok/s | Transferable lesson |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Exact fully bulk | 218.598 / 211.936 | Fix execution granularity first. |
| Exact dense-Q8 pack8 | 364.414 / 342.902 | Use output reuse before changed arithmetic. |
| Exact Q8 row reuse | 573.288 / 523.321 | Keep one encoded weight row across prompt rows. |
| Exact IQ4 one-wave K512 | 693.325 / 613.576 | Specialize real underfilled shapes. |
| Exact Q8 16x4 | 707.420 / 626.077 | Admit tile shapes only at measured crossovers. |
| Exact GDN LDS32 | 763.221 / 670.417 | Preserve ordered arithmetic while changing ownership. |
| Exact IQ3 rowbatch4 + GQA attention | 774.185 / 741.180 | Batch independent rows and reprofile after every promotion. |
| Guarded residual-D4x3 MMQ | 848.543 / 831.393 | Changed algebra can ship when uncertain BF16 outputs are repaired exactly. |

The guarded Qwen route is the closest internal precedent. It runs a
source-faithful raw-Q8_0 x residual-D4 Q8_1 128x128 K256 MMQ, queues outputs
within `1e-5` of a BF16 rounding boundary, and recomputes those outputs with the
exact reduction. Its 18-workload by 9-position continuation gate is
logit-bit-exact. The policy admits only two measured winning shapes; every
other shape retains exact 16x4/8x4/8x2/pack8 fallbacks.

Laguna must not copy Qwen's threshold or geometry blindly. Q4_K/Q6_K metadata,
K3072/K1024 shapes, top-10 expansion, nonlinear gate/up boundary, and gfx1151
are different. The transferable method is residual reconstruction,
BF16-boundary risk detection, bounded exact repair, and shape-scoped admission.

## Proposed production dataflow

The target gate/up flow is:

```text
BF16 hidden [M, 3072]
  -> residual Q8_1 pack once per token row
  -> existing device route count/prefix/compact metadata
  -> expert-major packed-dot Q4_K MMQ, 32 output columns x up to 32 natural rows
  -> BF16 candidate gate/up + device risk queue
  -> exact sparse Q4 correction for uncertain outputs
  -> existing exact SiLU/product boundary
```

The down flow starts after the exact SiLU/product boundary:

```text
compact BF16 expert intermediates [M * top_k, 1024]
  -> residual Q8_1 pack once per compact route row
  -> expert-major packed-dot Q4_K/Q6_K MMQ to 3072 outputs
  -> BF16 candidate down + device risk queue
  -> exact sparse Q4/Q6 correction
  -> existing ordered route-weighted combine/shared/residual chain
```

Important ownership rules:

- Gate/up quantization is over the original `M` producer rows. The compact
  metadata maps routed lanes back to those Q8 rows; it must not quantize or
  store the same input ten times.
- Down input is route-specific after SiLU, so it is packed over compact rows.
- Gate/up, SiLU, down, weighted combine, and residual remain separable
  registered primitives until each fused boundary is independently proven.
- Queue count, indices, thresholds, overflow state, and exact correction stay
  on device. No scalar D2H scheduling boundary is admitted.
- A queue overflow executes the complete exact projection or fails the
  candidate closed. It never truncates repairs.

## Resident weight-layout decision

Weight layout is a system decision, not a prefill-only microbenchmark result.
LAP-1 compared raw source blocks, byte-neutral X8, and the current T16
replacement under a strict one-resident-set contract:

- no persistent raw-plus-replacement or X8-plus-T16 expert family;
- temporary one-layer comparison buffers are allowed only for a leaf screen;
- the sole resident representation must preserve exact decode within 2%;
- every sidecar must publish family bytes, total peak, scratch, and context
  capacity before it can be considered;
- layout remains a quant-plugin concern, with no backend/quant branch in model
  or generic runtime code.

The prefill-only screen initially selected X8. It preserves all 144 bytes of
each source Q4_K block in
`[expert,out_pack8,k_block,col_in_pack8]`, occupies **905,969,664 bytes** for
the layer-1 gate/up pair, and improves raw MMQ32 by **9.82–12.14%**. The
live-row schedule then makes all frozen natural shapes positive.

The exact-decode screen reverses that system decision:

| Layout | Gate/up pair bytes | Actual exact selected decode | Decision |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Current T16 | 931,135,488 | c1/c2/c4/c8 **0.157223/0.351996/0.687016/1.350421 ms** | Sole resident baseline; exact decode already qualified |
| Byte-neutral X8 | 905,969,664 | **0.174663/0.362511/0.686471/1.332379 ms**, zero BF16 mismatches | Reject as sole c=1 layout: **1.11093x** T16 at c1 and **1.02987x** at c2 |
| Raw source rows | 905,969,664 | Existing exact/raw controls; slower MMQ32 than X8 | Diagnostic only |

The final X8 kernel is not a naive scalar fallback. It processes 16 gate and
16 up columns per local128 block, transposes Q4 nibbles and expands metadata
once per K256 interval into T16-shaped LDS, then uses the exact T16 arithmetic
and reduction order. Direct X8, raw LDS staging, and this complete transform
measure roughly **4.69x**, **2.08x**, and **1.11x** T16 at c1. The remaining
tax is layout recovery itself. Adding a full T16 sidecar would erase X8's only
resident-memory advantage and violate the one-set premise.

The selected production premise is therefore **T16 resident, T16-native
MMQ32**. T16 is only **25,165,824 bytes (2.778%)** larger than X8 for the
actual gate/up pair, is already the shipping allocation, and adds zero bytes
relative to the current runtime. The direct consumer reads T16's expanded
`d/dmin/scale/min` and interleaved Q4 payload while building the same 20-byte
per-column MMQ cache used by the proven raw/X8 body; it never transposes T16
back to raw/X8 in LDS.

X8 remains a frozen upper-bound control. Clean direct T16 is positive at every
natural shape, reaches **2.502x/3.959x/5.502x** retained on
M128/M256/M512, and is within **4.66%/4.05%/3.02%** of X8. The leaf decision
therefore passes. No new materializer is needed; LAP-2 repair and LAP-3
integration must preserve the existing one-set T16 residency and exact decode.

## Quality strategy

### Three comparison lanes

LAP-0 establishes three explicit resident modes:

| Lane | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| All-exact oracle | Exact tiled source-F16, exact global/SWA attention, exact grouped experts, and existing exact dense/shared paths |
| Shipping control | Current gfx1151 defaults, including admitted compensated/online paths |
| Candidate | Shipping control plus exactly one new LAP component |

Every new arithmetic path is compared both incrementally and cumulatively:

1. primitive output versus the CPU/source or exact GPU projection;
2. candidate versus the shipping control, for isolated performance and drift;
3. candidate versus the all-exact oracle, so separately admitted approximate
   kernels cannot silently spend the same KL budget several times.

LAP-0 first measures shipping-control versus all-exact cumulative KL/top-1. If
the shipping control is already above the repository gate, no additional
approximate route may be promoted until the debt is reconciled. A
BF16-bit-exact repaired projection remains admissible because it adds no debt.

### Repair policy

The preferred promotion target is BF16-bit equality after repair:

- residual D4x1/D4x2/D4x3 packs are evaluated on real production activations;
- the fast body writes a candidate value and an uncertainty measure;
- outputs whose BF16 rounding cell cannot be certified are queued;
- the exact current Q4/Q6 reduction recomputes only queued coordinates;
- an “all queued” test must reproduce the complete exact projection bit for
  bit.

An analytic error bound is preferred. An empirical distance threshold is
allowed only when it is selected on the declared calibration split, frozen
before heldouts, and passes the complete category/continuation suite. Thresholds
may depend on quant, projection role, and shape bucket. They may not depend on
prompt, token IDs, observed logits, category, or arbitrary layer ID.

Every artifact records:

- fast-versus-exact BF16 mismatch count before and after repair;
- maximum absolute/relative projection error;
- risk count, capacity, occupancy distribution, and overflow behavior;
- quantize/MMQ/repair time separately and inclusively;
- full-model cumulative KL/top-1 and complete free-running ID agreement;
- the exact fallback share by quant, role, and shape.

## Campaign sequence

```text
LAP-0 current oracle/profile
  -> LAP-1 source-faithful body + sole-resident T16 consumer
  -> LAP-2 residual arithmetic + exact repair
  -> LAP-3 selected Q4 gate/up
  -> LAP-4 selected Q4/Q6 down
  -> LAP-5 dense/shared Q4/Q6
  -> LAP-6 source-F16
  -> LAP-7 tiled attention
  -> LAP-8 residual/final parity
```

Reprofile after every promoted task. A later task does not start from the
pre-campaign Amdahl table.

Current progress:

| Task | State | Result / next condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LAP-0 | Complete | Fresh measured bridge, cumulative quality, routing, activation proxies, and unchanged Vulkan identity published. |
| LAP-1 | Complete | Direct resident-T16 MMQ32 is BF16-bit identical to X8, positive at all seven natural shapes, **2.502x/3.959x/5.502x** retained at M128/M256/M512, and within **4.66%/4.05%/3.02%** of X8 with no transpose or sidecar. |
| LAP-2 | In progress | Capture exact selected gate/up inputs, calibrate residual planes and BF16-boundary repair, and prove the bounded all-queued exact fallback. |
| LAP-3–LAP-8 | Blocked on predecessor | Preserve the frozen order and reprofile after every promotion. |

Immediate execution queue:

1. Prove the existing T16 materializer is the sole resident expert set for
   exact decode and candidate prefill: no raw/X8 sidecar, unchanged c1
   decode, bounded load scratch, exact lifecycle recovery, and published
   resident/context bytes.
2. Capture exact gate/up projection inputs from the complete calibration split,
   freeze residual-plane and BF16-boundary repair policy, and pass the all-queued
   bit-exact test (LAP-2).
3. Integrate one candidate gate/up route behind the four-axis registry, run the
   frozen M32/55/64/122/128/256/512 leaf crossover plus 128/512/1K/4K
   full-model profile, then run the complete category/heldout, h16/h32, Poolside,
   and lifecycle gate (LAP-3).
4. Rebuild the family bridge from that integrated trace. Start selected down
   only if gate/up remains admitted; revisit split full/tail symbols only if the
   trace attributes a material ceiling to full-tile predicate work.

### LAP-0 — freeze the current control and cumulative quality ledger (complete)

Deliverables:

- run a clean cached 128/512/1K/4K profile at `e4ab85d59` or its unchanged
  descendant;
- replace the inferred post-SWA attention time with measured current family
  attribution;
- preserve exact commands, kernel sum/span, calls, resources, model/hash,
  clocks, and lifecycle in one compact artifact;
- add an explicit all-exact session configuration and measure all-exact versus
  shipping-control quality over the complete category lane;
- capture compact activation/routing statistics needed by LAP-1/LAP-2 without
  committing prompt activations or raw logs;
- freeze the local Vulkan comparator revision/build and reuse its existing
  artifact unless source, binary, model, driver, or hardware changed.

Exit gate: one current bridge table whose families sum to at least 99.5% of
kernel time, plus a cumulative quality baseline. No optimization code lands in
this task.

Result: passed at
[`2026-07-24-gfx1151-laguna-prefill-lap0-control.json`](../benchmarks/results/2026-07-24-gfx1151-laguna-prefill-lap0-control.json).
Named non-`other` coverage is **99.653%** at M512; cumulative quality is finite
at max KL **0.0459275** and **319/320** top-1; all profile, routing, activation,
cursor, determinism, Poolside, and tracked-lifecycle checks pass. Public runtime
defaults are unchanged.

### LAP-1 — reproduce the packed-dot body and choose the resident layout

Before implementation, read [`KERNELS.md`](KERNELS.md) and run:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_lineage.py --kind kernel --diff stat
```

Deliverables:

- implement one standalone source-faithful 32x32 Q4_K x Q8_1 packed-dot MMQ
  body using staged weight/activation tiles and register reuse;
- use actual Laguna K3072/N1024 expert weights and natural M32/55/64/122/128/
  256/512 routing replays;
- compare raw source blocks, X8, and a direct current-T16 consumer;
- trace packed-dot instructions, workgroup, VGPR/SGPR, LDS, scratch, and tile
  occupancy;
- prove that the body, not just the activation pack, beats the current selected
  family before runtime integration;
- preserve the existing exact T16 decode leaf and prove one T16 resident set
  serves both decode and candidate prefill.

The current diagnostic scalar DS4, independent WMMA32/64, expanded-LDS,
packed-LDS, preview, and direct-T16 **WMMA** paths are controls only. The new
T16 MMQ kernel must materially differ by implementing the proven complete tile
reuse without a layout transpose.

Exit gate: direct-T16 MMQ is at least 2x inclusive over the retained expert body
on M128/M256/M512, positive on every natural shape, within 10% of the frozen
X8 control on the primary shapes, and uses no full expert sidecar or
per-dispatch layout transpose. Existing exact T16 decode remains bitwise and
performance unchanged. A smaller exact non-regressive sub-window may still be
retained under repository policy, but it does not advance the parity campaign.

Result so far: the first gfx1151 body maps Vulkan's 32-column by 32-row
Q4_K x Q8_1 tile to four wave32s in one 128-thread workgroup. It stages
20 bytes of Q4_K data per column and 36 bytes of DS4-Q8_1 data per routed row
for each K32 interval, reuses both tiles across the workgroup, and emits native
packed integer dot instructions. Q8_1 is packed once per producer row; compact
expert rows carry only a source-row index.

On actual layer-1 K3072/N1024 gate/up weights and natural routing counts,
including the producer-row pack, the raw body moves M256 **26.612 -> 10.047 ms
(2.649x)** and M512 **52.522 -> 12.720 ms (4.129x)** versus the retained
direct leaf. The current T16 WMMA diagnostic measures **6.297/9.307 ms**, but
uses a larger resident representation and its arithmetic is not quality-safe.
The raw layout is **864 MiB** for the pair versus **888 MiB** for T16.
Synthetic source-Q4_K x DS4-Q8_1 fixtures pass at maximum softmax KL
**4.745e-5** and **100%** top-1. A cached trace reports local128, allocated
VGPR120, LDS 2,048 bytes, zero scratch, and 64 static
`v_dot4_i32_iu8` instructions per wave.

The clean LAP-1 routing capture now covers all declared shapes. Across all 47
sparse layers, natural tile32 padding is **10.857/8.558/7.873/5.108/4.928/
2.930/1.866x** at M32/55/64/122/128/256/512, versus **2.911/2.402/2.260/
1.721/1.691/1.335/1.165x** for tile8. The actual layer-1 inclusive MMQ32
speedups are **0.680/0.899/0.985/1.515/1.551/2.645/4.117x** over retained
direct at the same shapes. Literal tile32 therefore loses at M32–M64, is
positive but below the 2x gate at M122/M128, and passes only M256/M512.

Three follow-up 8-row designs close the smaller packed-dot branch. A one-wave
32x8 body, four-wave cooperative 64x8 body, and paired-lane wave-local 16x8
body all lose to MMQ32 at every declared natural shape. At M128 they reach only
**1.098/0.926/1.269x** retained-direct versus **1.563x** for MMQ32; at M512
they reach **1.962/1.616/2.096x** versus **4.174x**. The first two reproduce
MMQ32 checksums exactly; the 16x8 primitive passes its focused KL/top-1 gate but
its natural diagnostic omitted one FP16 metadata-rounding step and was removed
without repair after the performance rejection. Cached traces show that lower
padding and VGPR do not offset repeated K3072 weight decode: the one-wave 32x8
tile costs about 405 us and the cooperative 64x8 tile about 522-531 us, versus
about 41 us per MMQ32 tile at the natural M128 leaf.

The whole-expert mixed screen also rejects the existing exact grouped-small-M
leaf as a tail. Threshold 1 is simply all-MMQ32; every threshold that sends
even one active expert to exact is slower at every shape. The lightest true
mixed case raises M128 **8.867 -> 11.625 ms (+31.10%)** and M512
**12.524 -> 13.294 ms (+6.15%)** before any device merge/scatter. All-exact
grouped-small-M itself is **43.622/136.742 ms** at M128/M512.

The first, prefill-only resident-layout screen selected the existing byte-exact
Q4_K X8 format. Raw and X8 share the complete packed-dot arithmetic body; X8
changes only the weight-block address. Two uneven/empty-expert fixtures,
including a nonidentity source-row map, are BF16-bit identical to raw and pass
the independent CPU KL/top-1 gate.

On the clean actual-weight screen, X8 improves raw MMQ32 by
**12.14/11.81/11.79/11.53/11.70/11.47/9.82%** at
M32/55/64/122/128/256/512. Its inclusive speedups over retained direct are
**0.766/1.011/1.105/1.693/1.735/2.957/4.554x**. Raw and X8 checksums match
exactly at every shape, both gate/up pairs occupy **905,969,664 bytes**, and
all tracked temporary buffers return to zero. That layout-only screen made X8
the provisional resident winner but did not change a runtime default because
M32 still lost and M128 had not yet satisfied the LAP-1 2x gate. The later
exact-decode screen above supersedes the resident conclusion while preserving
X8 as the fastest MMQ control.

The retained live-row schedule closes that body/shape gap without a second
geometry: it clamps the natural row count once per tile and skips packed-dot
accumulation for padded routes while preserving live-output arithmetic. Clean
producer-pack-inclusive X8 now measures **3.309/4.064/4.283/5.211/5.331/
6.515/9.330 ms**, or **1.197/1.567/1.704/2.526/2.587/4.092/5.614x**
retained at M32/55/64/122/128/256/512. Relative to the prior X8 screen, time
falls **36.45/35.57/35.22/32.77/32.77/27.41/18.65%**. Raw and X8 checksums
remain exact at every shape; the focused bundle reports 29 passes. Cached
tracing is local128, raw/X8 VGPR **40/48**, SGPR128, LDS 2,048 bytes, and zero
scratch.

This schedule has a recorded boundary: an all-full synthetic tile moves
**0.3881 -> 0.4204 ms (+8.34%)**. Natural Laguna routing is positive at every
frozen shape, so do not add another tail geometry now. If the integrated trace
shows full-tile predicate cost is material, separate full and tail metadata
into two symbols; otherwise avoid the extra launch and code.

The exact X8-native branch is now closed. After correcting the first
local256/eight-wave reduction-order bug, the final local128 kernel is BF16-bit
exact and dynamically constructs a T16-shaped 16-column tile in LDS. The clean
actual layer-1 c1/c2/c4/c8 medians are T16
**0.157223/0.351996/0.687016/1.350421 ms** versus X8
**0.174663/0.362511/0.686471/1.332379 ms**. X8 is **11.093%** slower at c1 and
**2.987%** slower at c2, then neutral/positive at c4/c8. All gate/up BF16
mismatch counts are zero, the temporary comparison peak is
**1,837,482,624 bytes**, and tracked ownership returns to zero. The c=1 target
therefore rejects X8 as the sole resident representation.

The direct-T16 branch closes LAP-1. Its clean producer-pack-inclusive times are
**3.383/4.173/4.419/5.399/5.543/6.769/9.597 ms**, or
**1.174/1.528/1.662/2.464/2.502/3.959/5.502x** retained direct at
M32/55/64/122/128/256/512. T16 is only **4.66%/4.05%/3.02%** behind X8 at
the primary shapes. T16/X8 BF16 checksums match at every shape, focused tests
report 31 passes, and cached tracing reports local128/VGPR48/LDS2048B/scratch0
with packed-dot ISA. Proceed immediately to LAP-2 calibration and LAP-3
integration. No threshold, small-row prototype, X8 materializer, or runtime
default is retained.

### LAP-2 — calibrate residual Q8_1 and exact repair

Deliverables:

- extend the Qwen residual-D4 and BF16-boundary machinery to Q4_K and Q6_K
  without coupling model code to Qwen;
- compare one, two, and three residual planes, block32 versus DS4/block128
  scaling, FP16 versus FP32 scale storage, and accumulation order;
- evaluate gate, up, Q4 down, and Q6 down independently on production
  activations and weights from all declared prompt categories;
- implement bounded risk queues, all-queued exact correction, deterministic
  overflow fallback, and queue-memory accounting;
- select a global `(quant, role, shape)` policy on calibration data and freeze
  it before heldout/category admission;
- report inclusive quantize + MMQ + repair time, not a prequantized body alone.

Exit gate: all-queued correction is BF16-bit exact; the selected policy passes
the primitive gate; post-repair mismatch is zero or the complete repository
quality lane passes without worsening the cumulative exact-oracle ledger; and
inclusive speed still satisfies LAP-1's primary body premise.

### LAP-3 — promote selected Q4 gate/up

Deliverables:

- quantize each BF16 token row once before top-10 expansion;
- consume the existing device-resident route count/prefix/compact map;
- process natural rows per expert and return compact gate/up rows in the
  existing lane order;
- test separate versus paired gate/up only after the shared-tile body works;
- preserve the separate exact SiLU chain and current selected/grouped fallback;
- choose row/occupancy crossovers from M32/55/64/68/96/122/128/256/512
  measurements, not a blanket M32 policy;
- run the full canonical category, Poolside, h16/h32, lifecycle, and cached
  trace gates before changing the backend capability.

Planning checkpoint: reduce the measured 3.674-second family toward
**1.0 second or less** and reach roughly **135-140 tok/s** overall at pp512.
Any exact same-suite non-regressive win is retained even if it misses that
checkpoint.

### LAP-4 — promote selected Q4/Q6 down

Deliverables:

- pack the exact BF16 SiLU/product output once per compact routed row;
- add separate source-faithful Q4_K and Q6_K packed-dot leaves;
- repair before the BF16 down boundary;
- retain the current ordered route-weighted combine as an unfused fallback;
- test weighted/fused output only after the unfused projection is admitted;
- carry forward the gate/up default and reprofile all families.

Planning checkpoint: selected gate/up plus down at **1.3 seconds or less** and
overall pp512 around **165-175 tok/s**. The prior 176 tok/s F16 diagnostic makes
this a demonstrated scheduling target, not a quality claim.

### LAP-5 — reuse the MMQ engine for dense and shared experts

Deliverables:

- apply the admitted Q4/Q6 body to layer-0 dense gate/up/down and all shared
  experts;
- use dense row tiles directly—no route-count or padded expert machinery;
- pair gate/up only where the inclusive real-model leaf wins;
- preserve exact rank-2 pack8/raw-Q6 fallbacks and shared-expert addition order;
- reject another duplicate pack8/T16 sidecar unless the total resident/context
  budget is explicitly better than the replacement-layout design;
- reprofile before touching source-F16.

Planning checkpoint: reduce the 0.640-second family toward **0.12 seconds or
less** and cross **200 tok/s** pp512.

### LAP-6 — close the source-F16 projection gap

The existing compensated WMMA path is about **6.285x** faster than exact at the
weighted M128 projection screen, but reaches only about 45-52% of the measured
inclusive hipBLASLt ceiling. It is retained only on SWA layers because the
all-layer quality route failed.

Deliverables:

- compare the custom compensated path with a torch-free, raw-pointer
  hipBLASLt route using the already measured inclusive conversion contract;
- reduce the current high-VGPR custom path only when a profile identifies a
  concrete occupancy or data-movement limit;
- add BF16-boundary exact repair or a higher-accuracy accumulation mode so
  coverage is selected by arithmetic/shape rather than global-versus-SWA layer
  identity;
- preserve exact tiled projection as the registered fallback;
- include Q/K/V/O and per-head attention-gate projections in the full model
  gate and cumulative exact-oracle ledger.

Planning checkpoint: reduce source-F16 from 0.895 seconds toward
**0.35 seconds or less** and reach roughly **275-290 tok/s** pp512.

### LAP-7 — build `KVLiveSpans`-aware cooperative tiled attention

Start only after a fresh post-LAP-6 profile puts attention at 10% or more of
kernel time, or the remaining comparator gap is dominated by it.

Deliverables:

- one in-tree M16-query x K64-key online-softmax design for head dimension 128;
- tiled QK and PV with FP32 accumulation and an explicitly gated BF16-KV to
  matrix-input conversion;
- complete `KVLiveSpans` handling: global spans, SWA physical rings, absolute
  positions, eviction masks, causal partial tiles, and 511/512/513 boundaries;
- raise the attention chunk above 128 only after full cursor/KV equivalence;
- retain exact global/SWA and current online row2 kernels as fallbacks;
- cover prior-context 0/64/128/384/896/1920/3968, SWA wraps, partial query
  tiles, and all canonical prompts.

Do not retry paired row2 score materialization, qgroup9, or the invalid
head-dim-128 AOTriton adapter. Those premises are closed.

Planning checkpoint: reduce current measured attention toward **0.08 seconds or
less**, exceed **310 tok/s**, and enter the 10%-of-Vulkan control band.

### LAP-8 — final residual profile and qualified parity

Deliverables:

- capture a new complete 128/512/1K/4K profile and rebuild the homologous
  Vulkan family table;
- touch router/norm/RoPE/tails only when one named family has a measured
  end-to-end ceiling of at least 5%;
- consider cross-operation fusion only with the required unfused registry
  fallback and bit/quality gate;
- keep graph/submission work closed until kernel span minus kernel sum exceeds
  5% or API tracing shows a repeated synchronization/copy boundary;
- rerun the external Vulkan row only if its source/build/runtime identity
  changed, and retain all protocol qualifications;
- publish the final benchmark artifact, rollup, changelog, kernel catalog,
  refactor cleanup, and WORKLOG handoff.

## Milestones

These are planning checkpoints, not promises or minimum thresholds for keeping
a valid smaller win:

| Milestone | pp512 target | Interpretation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Expert gate/up | 135-140 tok/s | Primary 53% mapped gap is materially closed. |
| All selected experts | 165-175 tok/s | Fast expert-major scheduling is quality-safe. |
| All quant linear | >=200 tok/s | Dense/shared reuse is working. |
| Quant + source-F16 | 275-290 tok/s | Linear projection architecture is comparator-class. |
| Gap substantially closed | >=310 tok/s | Within 10% of the 344.56 Vulkan control. |
| Parity band | >=327.3 tok/s | Within 5% of the Vulkan control. |
| Stretch | >=344.56 tok/s | Match/beat the qualified external row. |

All headline rows also report canonical category-weighted prefill and
128/1K/4K behavior. A repeated-token 512 number cannot promote a path by itself.

## Promotion gates

Every new or ported kernel follows [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) and
[`BENCHMARK.md`](BENCHMARK.md). At minimum:

### Primitive and dispatch

- RED test before implementation where practical;
- CPU/source oracle at tiny and production dimensions;
- KL <= 0.05 and top-1 >= 90% for any non-bit-exact primitive;
- exact raw-pointer ABI and four-axis registry resolution;
- no backend/quant branch in engine, model, or generic dispatch code;
- cached `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` proving the intended symbol, duration,
  workgroup, VGPR/SGPR, LDS, and scratch;
- unfused/exact fallback and automatic fallback below unmeasured shapes.

### Full-model quality

- all-exact, shipping-control, and candidate lanes in one resident load;
- all ten canonical prompts across `code`, `general_en`, `general_ja`, and
  `mixed_ja_en`, including heldouts;
- 320-step teacher-forced full-vocabulary comparison;
- deterministic free-running h16/h32 repeats and complete ID reporting;
- frozen Poolside first-token oracle;
- suite-wide and per-category top-1 >= 90%, max KL <= 0.05;
- cumulative candidate-versus-all-exact result recorded;
- no prompt-conditioned or observed-output-conditioned policy.

### Performance and ownership

- at least three counterbalanced same-session timing repetitions;
- aggregate and every-category prefill positive for a default promotion;
- aggregate h16/h32 E2E positive, every category/horizon E2E >= 0.98x;
- decode within 2%;
- 128/512/1K/4K milestone reporting;
- model load excluded and exact command recorded;
- all allocations freed, repeated sessions deterministic, and no hidden D2H
  control boundary;
- queue/sidecar/scratch bytes and context-capacity effect stated.

## Stop rules and closed work

Stop or change premise when:

- a prequantized MMQ body is not at least 2x on the primary expert shapes;
- inclusive pack + MMQ + repair loses the body advantage;
- exact repair requires a full-family sidecar or unbounded queue;
- the replacement layout cannot provide an exact decode/fallback path;
- a policy passes a short shape but fails the complete category/heldout lane;
- a post-promotion profile moves the bottleneck to another family;
- the remaining family has less than a 5% perfect-removal ceiling.

Do not repeat:

- expert-major compensated F16 component or layer-family bisection;
- arbitrary layer subsets selected from prompt outcomes;
- one-plane direct Q8_1 gate/up promotion;
- scalar grouped gate/up C4/C8/C16;
- independent WMMA wave widening;
- per-block LDS unpack/staging without complete tile reuse;
- X8 exact decode via local256, direct raw addressing, raw LDS staging, output
  widening alone, or dynamic X8-to-T16 reconstruction;
- per-dispatch T16-to-raw/X8 shared transposes. Direct T16 MMQ addressing is
  explicitly the next design and is not part of this closed work;
- qgroup9, paired-row exact attention, or row2 score materialization;
- AOTriton Laguna head-dim-128 adaptation without a newly supported geometry;
- graph replay or launch-count work while span-minus-sum is sub-percent.

Temporary selectors must receive a `docs/REFACTOR.md` removal trigger when they
land.

## Definition of done

The campaign is complete when one of these conditions is documented:

1. hipEngine reaches at least the **327.3 tok/s parity band** at pp512 under its
   retained quality/lifecycle protocol, with no 128/1K/4K or category
   regression and a qualified comparison to Vulkan; or
2. every mapped family has a retained non-regressive route or a prospectively
   rejected new arithmetic premise, a fresh profile explains at least 99.5% of
   remaining wall, and the residual blocker is explicit enough to require a new
   architecture rather than more local tuning.

Matching **344.56 tok/s** is the stretch outcome. Because the Vulkan control
uses a different token stream, F16 KV, and backend numerical policy, “beat
llama.cpp” requires a matched timing/token/KV contract or an explicit
qualification. The unqualified engineering goal is simpler: remove the measured
5.23-second hipEngine family deficit while preserving hipEngine's stricter
correctness contract.
