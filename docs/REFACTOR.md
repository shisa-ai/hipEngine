# hipEngine Refactor / Dead-Path Ledger

This file tracks cleanup work that should happen after the fast/correct path is
proven. During optimization, temporary flags and fallback paths are useful for
bisection; after the optimal path stabilizes, they become dispatch confusion and
should be removed or collapsed.

## Policy

- Exact, same-suite non-regressive performance wins should become defaults.
- Keep opt-out flags only while they are useful for rollback, bisection, or a
  named validation gap.
- When a flag is left in place, record the removal trigger here.
- Do not remove unfused numerical fallbacks required by `AGENTS.md`; remove dead
  runtime dispatch branches and stale experiment toggles first.

## Cleanup Ledger

| Area | Debt | Current status | Removal trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MTP P1 verifier | `HIPENGINE_W4_DUAL_OUTPUT_TILED_SPLIT_PREFILL` opt-out around the promoted split-output dual W4 shared-gate/up route. | Default-on after 2026-06-11 D32 9-prompt exact A/B: same acceptance, verify `22.98 -> 22.37 ms/cycle`. | After the next retained MTP gate with defaults-on passes at the target sprint shape, remove the opt-out or demote it to a test-only override. |
| MTP P1 verifier | `HIPENGINE_LINEAR_OUT_CAST_ROTATE_FUSED` opt-out around promoted `f32_to_fp16 + paro_rotate1` fusion. | Default-on after raw-bit RED test and 2026-06-11 D32 9-prompt exact A/B; removes 30 launches/pass and contributes to the stacked `-0.60 ms/cycle` suite delta. | After the next retained MTP gate with defaults-on passes, collapse the old runtime dispatch branch if no other path still needs it. |
| MTP P1 verifier | `HIPENGINE_SELECTED_MOE_DOWN_STAGED` opt-in around the superseded staged selected SiLU/down-rotate + down GEMV path. | Flipped default-off on 2026-06-11 after current graph-auto D32 9-prompt exact A/B: identical acceptance, cycle `27.648 -> 27.408 ms/cycle`, verify `22.377 -> 22.131 ms/cycle`. The staged path remains available with `=1` for bisection and historical comparison. | After the next retained MTP gate with defaults-on passes, remove the staged runtime branch or demote it to a kernel test-only path unless a new barrier-free implementation beats the fallback. |
| MTP P2 proposer | `HIPENGINE_MTP_PROPOSER_SKIP_UNUSED_READS` opt-out around skipped discarded expert-topk host reads, update-only lm-head/argmax results, and final draft snapshot saves. | Default-on after 2026-06-11 D32 9-prompt exact gates: same acceptance/visible tokens, read/result skip moved actual speed `0.664x -> 0.670x`, cycle wall `27.94 -> 27.68 ms`, proposal/update `2.145 -> 2.052 ms`; final-snapshot skip then stayed exact `9/9`, skipped `142` D2D snapshot saves, and trimmed proposal/update `2.052 -> 2.045 ms` with flat actual ratio within noise. | After the next retained MTP gate with defaults-on passes, remove the opt-out or demote it to a test-only override. Keep the functional code path; it is the desired proposer behavior. |
| MTP verifier rejected gate | `HIPENGINE_FUSED_RMSNORM_ROTATE` opt-in for M15.4 fused input RMSNorm + PARO rotate2. | Default-off; current-stack retest on 2026-06-11 stayed exact but regressed verifier kernel `13.41 -> 14.09 ms/pass` and host window `18.45 -> 19.05 ms/pass`. | After the MTP break-even path is stable, remove the runtime gate or demote it to a kernel test-only path unless a new implementation avoids the one-block RMSNorm occupancy trap. |
| MTP verifier docs | Older "default-off diagnostic" notes for P1 gates can become stale as promoted defaults land. | `docs/MTP.md`, `benchmarks/README.md`, and `WORKLOG.md` carry historical rows plus current status. | During each MTP sprint commit, update current-status language and leave old measurements only as dated history. |
| Env flag surface | Many perf flags exist for rejected or superseded experiments. | Useful while chasing break-even, but confusing for dispatch reasoning. | Once 35B MTP has a retained `>1.0x` row, do a flag audit: keep correctness fallbacks, remove rejected perf flags, and document the final optimal dispatch path. |

## Post-Optimal-Path Cleanup Targets

These are not optimization tasks for the current sprint. They are the cleanup
pass to run once a path is fast and correct enough that the benchmark defaults
should be boring.

| Path | Cleanup target | Keep | Remove / collapse trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 35B MTP chain verifier | Collapse the sprint-era stack of env flags into the default dispatch path and document the single optimal B=3 chain route. | Numerical fallbacks, exactness tests, and rollback toggles that are still needed for one release window. | Retained `>1.0x` same-suite row plus one follow-up defaults-only rerun. |
| 35B MTP tree/top-k | Keep tree code default-off until it beats chain on the same wall and prompt suite; do not let tree-specific dispatch obscure the chain hot path. | Tree correctness tests and graph replay scaffolding. | If tree remains negative after the verifier wall cut, demote branch/top-k runtime flags to explicit experiment scripts. |
| 27B dense DFlash | Separate deployable online routing from profile-history diagnostics. The current positive production row is the online whole-cycle confidence gate; older prompt-history route/terminal-tail rows are retained evidence, not the default API shape. | Online gate config, oracle/calibration tooling, exact AR comparisons. | After the DFlash hardening rerun and decode API update, trim profile-history routing from the main hot path or move it behind an explicit research harness. |
| DFlash drafter/verifier flags | Audit `HIPENGINE_DFLASH_DRAFTER_DENSE`, `HIPENGINE_DFLASH_DRAFTER_ADD_RMSNORM`, and `HIPENGINE_DFLASH_VERIFY_FUSED_LM_HEAD`. | Default-on exact dense WMMA if the fresh 27B gate confirms it; tests for rejected fused kernels. | Fresh 27B DFlash rerun decides: promote exact positive flags to defaults, remove negative runtime branches, or demote them to test-only overrides. |
| Benchmark commands | Stop requiring long flag piles once defaults represent the optimal path. | Flags that select workload shape, model, quant, and explicit experiments. | After MTP/DFlash defaults-only rows are retained, update benchmark docs to show default commands first and move historical A/B flags into dated notes. |
